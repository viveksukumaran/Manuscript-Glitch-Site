    Task Management
  </h4>
  <div class="FeatureBlock__body">
    <p>Track projects from start to finish. Divide them up into tasks and subtasks, then set their priority and assign them to different team members. Your whole team will know what theyâ€™re working on, and with due dates, everything gets delivered on time.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="GraphicExample__title">

    Stay Productive with Fewer Meetings
  </h4>
  <div class="FeatureBlock__body">
    <p>Each case provides the context you need to understand a task. From priority, due date, to task dependencies and who else is interested in the progress and outcome of a task.</p>
    <p>Notifications keep you up to date with the latest progress, so you can drop the catchup meetings - as all the notes, questions, files, and progress are clear and in one place.</p>
  </div>

    Built-in Accountability
  </h4>
  <div class="FeatureBlock__body">
    <p>By default, tasks are assigned to a single person - so you know where responsibility lies, and who is working on a task at any one time. When tasks are resolved, they go back to their creator for sign-off.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="GraphicExample__title">

    Task Management that Scales
  </h4>
  <div class="FeatureBlock__body">
    <p>Organize tasks by project, area or team, and customize workflows to suit each of them. Powerful project management features keep everything on track. And flexible permissions means team members only see what they need to, and client data is secure.</p>
